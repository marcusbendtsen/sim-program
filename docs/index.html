	  <p class="lead">
	    High-quality digital behavior interventions could be part of a revived societal response to the continuing burden 
	    that alcohol consumption, poor diet, inadequate physical activity, and smoking place on societies. 
	    The short-term effects of digital behavior interventions have been established in randomized controlled trials; 
	    however, we need to gain knowledge of their long-term impact on the incidence of non-communicable diseases, mental
	    health conditions, quality of life, disability-adjusted life years, healthcare- and societal costs, and the environment. Furthermore, we do not know how
	    these long-term outcomes are distributed among different groups in society; thus, we do not know if they will
	    lead to reduced health inequalities. The SIM research program will fill this knowledge gap by developing and
	    utilizing an agent-based model that will simulate the life course of virtual cohorts congruent with the target
	    population of a specific intervention. This will allow for counterfactual argumentation concerning long-term
	    outcomes conditional on access to interventions and provide a means to study which groups in society benefit
	    the most and the least from interventions.

            <p>
	      In this project, we will consolidate evidence regarding behavior, health, quality of life, mortality, healthcare- and societal costs, and environmental impact. 
	      Findings will be used to model risks of non-communicable diseases and mental health conditions and consequences of the realization of these events.

	      In this project, we will use Swedish national registries to define the initial state of the
	      virtual cohorts and estimate conditional probabilities of life course events. These life course events relate to
	      education, household characteristics, employment, income trajectories, and sick leave.

	      In this project, we will measure the reach and adoption of three digital behavioral interventions to study if
	      and when dissemination can lead to implementation and at what cost. An additional aim of this study is to
	      expand upon what is known about the acceptability of digital behavioral interventions.

	      <li>To what extent can digital behavioral interventions reduce the incidence of non-communicable diseases, mental health conditions, improve quality of life over the life span, and reduce healthcare and societal costs?</li>
	      <li>How will the long-term outcomes of digital behavioral interventions be distributed among demographic and socioeconomic groups, and will their dissemination result in reduced health inequalities?</li>

            <p>
	      In this project, we will provide guidance for critical challenges concerning the distribution of scarce resources in today’s priority practice of prevention programs. 
	      We will approach the challanges using a combination of health-economic modeling and normative analysis,
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>How do we distribute scarce resources to achieve equitable health over different demographic and socioeconomic groups?</li>
	      <li>How do we assess the severity of a risk condition, potentially resulting in ill health in the future, compared with manifest conditions when prevention and treatment compete for resources?</li>
	      <li>Given that time-sensitive discounting is today's priority practice, how can we handle the fact that the conditions we prevent will occur in the future?</li>

	    <p>
	      In this project, we will determine factors influencing the development and maintenance of lifestyle behavior interventions. We also aim to determine regulatory policy’s role in supporting public health’s effectiveness.
